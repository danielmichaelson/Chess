# Chess
GUI and Command Line Based Chess

This is a chess game made in Java that can be played in a GUI or Command Line (or both simultaneously!). The game includes the option to play with custom pieces ([Wazir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazir_(chess)) and [AntiPawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berolina_chess)), as well as other options such as forfeiting and undoing a move. I programmed all logic and GUI elements. Main.java should be run to start the game. Game.java contains all game logic, ChessGUI.java contains all GUI logic, Board.java is the board object, Piece.java is the main class for all Pieces, and Player.java is the player object.
